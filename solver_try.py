"""
In this example, the code will print out the possible locations for the survivor to move where they will find supplies and avoid zombies. If no such positions exist, it will return an empty list.

This is a simplistic use of python-constraint in a zombie apocalypse scenario, but it gives you an idea of how you might begin to tackle such a problem. You can add more complex constraints, such as fuel usage, time constraints, other survivors' positions, and so on.

Remember, this doesn't actually implement the movement or the graphic part of a simulation - it's just solving for possible safe positions in a theoretical grid. To implement this in a game or simulation, you'd need to incorporate game development techniques and likely use other libraries to handle graphics, user input, etc.
"""

"""
It's important to note that while the Python Constraint library can help with modeling the relationships and constraints in your simulation, you will likely need to combine it with other components, such as a grid-based environment, movement rules, infection dynamics, etc., to create a more comprehensive and interactive simulation.
