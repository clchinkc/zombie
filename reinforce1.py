"""
Use a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to train the person's behavior in the zombie apocalypse.

To implement the reinforcement learning approach, we would first need to define a set of states, actions, 
and rewards that the person can experience in the zombie apocalypse. 
For example, the states could include the person's current location, the number of zombies nearby, 
and the availability of weapons or other resources. 
The actions could include moving to a new location, attacking a zombie, or hiding in a safe place. 
The rewards could reflect the person's survival, such as a positive reward for killing zombies 
and a negative reward for being killed by zombies.

Next, we would need to define a reinforcement learning algorithm, such as Q-learning, 
to learn a policy for selecting actions based on the current state and the observed rewards. 
This could be done by training the algorithm on a set of simulated scenarios, 
where the person's actions and the resulting rewards are recorded and used to update the policy.

Once the policy has been trained, we can use it to determine the person's actions in the simulation. 
This would involve observing the person's current state and selecting the action that is predicted 
to maximize the expected rewards according to the learned policy.

In this the code, we simulate the person's behavior for a fixed number of steps (1000 in this case) 
and choose a random event at each step. 
This allows the agent to learn from a variety of different scenarios and improve its policy for selecting actions. 
At the end of the simulation, we print the final q_values table to see how the agent has learned to select actions in each state.
