"""
To create a stock prediction model and predict the stock price later, you will need several things:

Historical stock data: You will need a dataset of historical stock data to train your model on. This data should include the stock's price, as well as other relevant factors such as volume, market conditions, and any relevant news or events. You can use a library such as yfinance or pandas_datareader to retrieve this data from a financial data provider such as Yahoo Finance.

A prediction model: You will need to decide on a prediction model to use, such as a linear regression model, a decision tree, or a neural network. You will then need to train this model on your historical data to make predictions.

Feature engineering: You may need to perform feature engineering on your data to extract relevant features that can be used to make predictions. This may involve creating new features based on the existing data, or selecting a subset of the existing features to use in your model.

Evaluation metrics: You will need to decide on evaluation metrics to use to evaluate the performance of your model. Common evaluation metrics for stock prediction include mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and mean absolute percentage error.

Validation and testing: You will need to split your data into training, validation, and testing sets, and use the validation set to tune your model's hyperparameters. Once you have trained and tuned your model, you can use the testing set to evaluate its performance.

Make predictions: Once you have trained and evaluated your model, you can use it to make predictions on new data. You can use the model to predict the stock price for a specific date, or to predict the stock's future price based on historical data.
