guide to write function:
1. do one thing and do it well
2. separate command (perform action) from query (retrieve information) (command should not return anything, query should not change the state of the program)
3. only require information that is needed (get one level of abstraction lower)
4. keep number of parameter minimal
5. don't create and use an object in the same place (therefore the factory pattern)
6. don't use flag parameter (a parameter that can change the behaviour of a function completely, usually a boolean),  use multiple function instead
7. avoid side effect (a function that change the state of the program, like print, change a global variable, change a parameter)
8. remember function is first class object, can be passed as parameter, can be returned by function, can be stored in data structure
