Project Idea: Multi-factor Stock Portfolio Optimization

Objective: Create an optimized stock portfolio using multi-factor analysis and Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) in Python. This project aims to maximize the risk-adjusted returns by selecting an ideal combination of stocks based on historical data and applying mean-variance optimization.

Steps:

Data Collection:
Collect historical stock price data from a reliable source like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.
Collect other relevant financial data such as market capitalization, P/E ratio, dividend yield, etc.

Data Preprocessing:
Clean the data, handling missing values and outliers.
Calculate the daily returns, average returns, and volatility for each stock.
Normalize the financial data.

Feature Engineering:
Create custom factors based on fundamental and technical analysis (e.g., momentum, growth, value, etc.).
Combine these factors to create a multi-factor ranking score for each stock.

Portfolio Construction:
Select a subset of stocks with the highest multi-factor scores.
Calculate the covariance matrix and expected returns for the selected stocks.
Apply MPT to find the optimal weights for each stock in the portfolio.

Backtesting and Evaluation:
Backtest the optimized portfolio using historical data.
Calculate performance metrics such as Sharpe Ratio, Cumulative Returns, and Maximum Drawdown.
Compare the optimized portfolio's performance (etc beta) against a benchmark index.

Visualizations:
Create plots to visualize the performance of the optimized portfolio and benchmark index.
Visualize the weights of each stock in the optimized portfolio and the performance metrics of each stock.
