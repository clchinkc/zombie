To implement a simulation of a person's activity during a zombie apocalypse at school, we would need to define several classes and functions to represent the different elements of the simulation.

First, we would need a Person class to represent each person in the simulation. This class would have attributes to track the person's location, state (alive, undead, or escaped), health, and any weapons or supplies they may have. It would also have methods to move the person on the grid and interact with other people and zombies.

Next, we would need a Zombie class to represent each zombie in the simulation. This class would have similar attributes and methods as the Person class, but would also include additional attributes and methods to simulate the behavior of a zombie (such as attacking living people and spreading the infection).

We would also need a School class to represent the layout of the school and track the locations of people and zombies on the grid. This class would have a two-dimensional array to represent the grid, with each cell containing a Person or Zombie object, or None if the cell is empty. The School class would also have methods to move people and zombies on the grid and update their states based on the rules of the simulation.

Finally, we would need a main simulate function that would set up the initial conditions of the simulation (such as the layout of the school, the number and distribution of people and zombies, and any weapons or supplies), and then run the simulation for a specified number of steps. This function would use the School class to move people and zombies on the grid and update their states, and could also include additional code to track and display the progress of the simulation.

class Person:
    def __init__(self, x, y, state, health, weapons, supplies):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.state = state
        self.health = health
        self.weapons = weapons
        self.supplies = supplies

    def move(self, dx, dy):
        self.x += dx
        self.y += dy

    def attack(self, other):
        # Attack the other person with a weapon, if possible
        pass

    def defend(self, other):
        # Defend against the other person's attack, if possible
        pass

    def escape(self):
        # Attempt to escape the school, if possible
        pass
        
class Zombie:
  def __init__(self, location, health):
    self.location = location
    self.health = health
    
  def move(self, direction):
    # update zombie's location based on direction
    
  def attack(self, person):
    # simulate attack on a living person
    
    
class School:
  def __init__(self, layout):
    self.layout = layout  # 2D array representing school layout
    self.people = []  # list of Person objects
    self.zombies = []  # list of Zombie objects
    
  def move_person(self, person, direction):
    # move person in specified direction
    
  def move_zombie(self, zombie, direction):
    # move zombie in specified direction
    
  def update_states(self):
    # update state of each person and zombie based on rules of simulation
    
    
def simulate(layout, num_steps):
  # create School object with specified layout
  # add people and zombies to school
  # simulate num_steps steps of the zombie apocalypse
